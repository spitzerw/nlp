The synthesis was carried out using commercially available reagents. The GdCl3 6H2O was 99.99% pure and supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company. All the other chemicals were analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
The pure Li4Ti5O12(LTO) was prepared using a hydrothermal method followed by calcination as reported by Wang et al. [12] In the typical synthesis procedures, 1.7 ml (5 mM) of tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) and 0.189 g of LiOH·H2O were thoroughly mixed in 20 ml of ethanol at room temperature. The solution was mixed completely with a magnetic stirrer in a closed container for 24 h and 25 ml of deionized water were added to the container. After stirring for 0.5 h, the solution was transferred to a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and placed in an oven at 180 °C for 36 h to obtain Li1.81H0.19Ti2O5·xH2O (H-LTO). The white H-LTO powder on the bottom of the reactor was collected, washed with ethanol 3 times, and dried at 80 °C for 6 h. Finally, the white hydrothermal H-LTO product was heated to 700 °C for 6 h in a horizontal tube furnace in air to obtain the pure Li4Ti5O12.
The experimental procedures described in Section 2.2 were used to prepare the H-LTO-Gd3+ precursor by doping with the appropriate amount of Gd3+ in the mixture consisting 1.7 ml (5 mM) of tetrabutyl titanate, 0.189 g of LiOH·H2O, and 20 ml of ethanol. The white hydrothermal H-LTO-Gd product was heated to 700 °C for 6 h in a horizontal tube furnace in air to obtain Gd3+ doped LTO nanosheets.
The ultrathin LTO-Gd-C nanosheets were prepared by controlling the amount of carbon precursor (D(t)-glucose monohydrate) used in the experimental procedures described in Section 2.3 for the LTO-Ln3+ doped LTO nanosheets. The H-LTO-Gd precursors were prepared using the experimental procedures described in Section 2.3. 200 mg of the H-LTO-Gd precursor were dispersed in 10 ml of ethanol under magnetic stirring to form Solution A. D(t)-glucose monohydrate in the amount corresponding to 2.5, 5, or 10 wt% of the H-LTO-Gd precursor was dissolved in 5 ml of ethanol to produce Solution B. Solution B was added dropwise to Solution A under stirring, followed by slow evaporation at 80 °C into a slurry. The slurry was heated under Ar/H2(5%) at 700 °C for 6 h. The products with different nominal carbon contents were designated as LTO-Gd-C (2.5%), LTO-Gd-C (5%), and LTO-Gd-C (10%). For comparison, a composite corresponding to LTO-Gd-C (5%) without Gd3+ dopant was synthesized using H-LTO as the precursor and designated as LTO-C (5%).
The electrochemical tests were conducted on the two-electrode CR2032 type coin cells. The working electrodes were prepared by pasting a mixture of the active materials (LTO, LTO-Gd, LTO-C, LTO-Gd-C), carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 80:10:10 onto a Cu foil with a thickness about 0.2 mm and an area about 2 cm2, which acted as the current collector. The electrodes were dried at 80 °C for 6 h in air and 120 °C in vacuum for another 12 h followed by pressing. Each electrode was weighed accurately on an electronic balance and the weight of the active materials was controlled to be 1–2 mg. The coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled gloved box with a metallic lithium foil as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1, volume ratio) and Celgard 2400 polypropylene was the separator. The charging/discharging experiments were performed at various current densities over a voltage range of 1–2.5 V (vs Li/Li+) using a multi-channel battery test system (NEWARE BTS-610). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D) in the voltage range of 1–2.5 V (vs Li/Li+) at different scanning rates and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted by applying a perturbation voltage of 10 mV in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation.
