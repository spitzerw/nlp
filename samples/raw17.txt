Composite electrodes were comprised of the prepared powders (NMC Bare, NMC/4ALD and NMC:LMO = 1:1), carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (90:5:5) in N-methylpyrrolidinon. The composite was coated onto high grade Al foil current collector and roll-pressed after dried in air at 80 °C for 1 h. The electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h before use. The separators were thick porous silica and the electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DEC (1:1 volume ratio). Cell tests were done with a 2032 coin-type cell using Li metal as the anode.

All assembled cells were allowed to rest for at least 10 h at room temperature prior to electrochemical tests. For cycle-life tests, the cells were cycled between 3.0 and 4.5 V at low rate of C/4 (40 mAg−1) during the initial two cycles. The cells were charged and discharged between 3.0 and 4.5 V by applying a constant 1 C current (160 mA−1) and 30 min voltage hold at 4.5 V. The cycle-life tests at 55 °C were performed at both 3.0–4.3 V and 3.0–4.5 V with the same constant current (1 C-rate, 160 mAg−1). Rate studies were tested (3.0–4.5 V) using a symmetric galvanostatic profile with the current systematically increased (160–320–640–1280–2560 mAg−1 for NMC Bare and NMC/4ALD cells and 130–260–520–1040–2080 mAg−1 for NMC:LMO) every three cycles and 30 min voltage hold at 4.5 V. AC impedance was performed using a Solatron 1280C for a frequency range of 20,000–0.0025 Hz. Impedance measurements were taken on 3rd, 30th, 60th and 100th cycle (1 C-rate cycling, 3.0–4.5 V) at fully charged state. For galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements, a constant current flux was supplied for 2250 s (∼C/10-rate) followed by an open circuit stand of the cell for 3600 s. This procedure was continued for the full charge voltage range (3.0–4.5 V) varying composition x in Lix(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 and repeated at 3rd, 30th, 60th and 100th cycle during 1 C-rate cycling.
