Commercial large-format pouch cells (manufactured by Kokam) of 40 A h nominal capacity were tested. The cells comprised of Li(NiMnCo)O2 (NMC) as positive and graphite as negative electrode material. 
One cell was cycled at room temperature (referred hereafter as “RT”), one at +45 °C (“45C”) for both charge and discharge, and one at +45 °C for charge and at +65 °C for discharge (“45C/65C”). The RT and 45C cells were cycled until the capacity had dropped to approximately 80% of the nominal capacity, and the 45C/65C cell until approximately 50% of the nominal capacity. Charge–discharge cycling tests were done in periods of approximately 100 cycles. Cycling was carried out as full cycles at 1C rate (40 A) inside a voltage range of 2.7–4.2 V. The cells were charged at constant current until the cut-off voltage was reached, after which charging was continued at constant voltage until the current had reduced to 2 A (0.05C). Discharge was performed at constant current.

The charge–discharge cycling was conducted with the help of a custom-built test bench. The test bench consisted of two BK Precision 8514 1200 W programmable DC loads for cell discharging, two Agilent 6671A 8 V/220 A DC power supplies for charging, and rectifier diodes to prevent power supply polarity reversal. For elevated temperature cycling, the 45C and 45C/65C cells were placed in separate temperature chambers, where the cell surface temperatures were monitored. For the 45C cell, the ambient temperature was set to +45 °C, for the 45C/65C cell the ambient temperature was varied (+45 °C/+65 °C) and charge/discharge cycling was resumed once the measured cell surface temperature had stabilized to the correct temperature.
AC impedance measurements were conducted with an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N) and an Autolab frequency response analyzer (Eco Chemie B.V., version 4.9). The measurements were performed in galvanostatic mode with 0.5 A perturbation amplitude inside 4000–0.1 Hz frequency range. The experiments were conducted at room temperature. Impedance spectra were measured for the cycled cells at intervals of approximately 100 cycles. After each cycling period and prior to the impedance measurement, the OCV was adjusted to 3.72 V (±0.01 V). According to manufacturer’s specification and experimental characterization of a non-cycled cell, the 3.72 V OCV corresponds to 50% SOC.
