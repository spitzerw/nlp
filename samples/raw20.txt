Two Li4Ti5O12 powders (Sachtleben Pigments) were used as active materials. Samples are labeled hereafter as LTO-SP and LTO-LP according to the primary particle size (SP for smaller primary particle size and LP for larger primary particle size). These materials have been synthesized using the same pilot scale method and the difference in the particle size results from different milling processes. Morphology of the particles was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7500FA). Particle sizes were calculated from the SEM images measuring 212 LTO-SP and 455 LTO-LP particles. BET measurements were done using Nova 3200 surface area analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments).

Electrode slurries were prepared by mixing LTO, carbon black (C65, Timcal), and PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Ashland) in weight ratios 92:3:5 for carbon containing electrodes and 95:0:5 for carbon free electrodes. Electrode slurries were then coated on an aluminum foil and dried at 80 °C overnight. 14 mm electrodes were cut from the dried electrode foils and calendered with a pressure of 3300 kg cm−2.

Electrodes were dried overnight at 110 °C under vacuum before assembling 2016 coin cells in an argon filled glove box (oxygen and water vapor levels below 1 ppm). Lithium metal foil (0.38 mm in thickness, Aldrich) was used as a counter electrode, and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate:dimethyl carbonate 1:1 w/w (LP30, Merck) as an electrolyte. 260 μm thick glass microfiber filter (GF/A, Whatman) was used as a separator. Charging/discharging experiments were conducted using a Neware battery cycler. Galvanostatic charging and discharging was done between 1.1 and 2.5 V vs. Li/Li+ using C-rates from 0.1C to 10C. C-rates were calculated using the theoretical capacity of Li4Ti5O12 (175 mAh g−1) and 1C corresponds to complete charging or discharging in 1 h. Low temperature measurements were done at 0 °C and −20 °C in temperature chamber (Vötsch). Temperature was let to stabilize for 1 h before the measurements.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted with an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT302N) using 3-electrode set up (Hohsen HS-3E test cell) with a lithium metal foil counter and reference electrode. Frequency range of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz and voltage amplitude of 10 mV were used.
