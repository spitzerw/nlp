The pristine Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05(OH)2 precursor was obtained by commercial supply. The in situ oxidizing-coating process was implemented as below. KMnO4 powder was dissolved in deionized water to form a 0.1 mol L−1 solution. Subsequently, 10 g Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05(OH)2 precursor was dispersed in deionized water, followed by dripping 20 mL the as-prepared KMnO4 solution with magnetic stirring. On the surface of the precursor, Ni2+ was immediately oxidized into Ni3+, accompanied by the precipitation of MnO2. As a result, the dark green solid powder was changed into dark brown, and the dripped violet liquid immediately became clear. But the violet could no longer fade within 1 h when about 15 mL KMnO4 solution was dripped in. Then excess 5 mL was added with stirring for 0.5 h. After reaction, the dark brown powder was recovered by filtration, washed three times with deionized water and dried at 110 °C overnight. Finally, the MnO2-coated Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05(OH)2 and LiOH·H2O were thoroughly mixed with a molar ratio of 1:1.05 before being sintered at 750 °C for 15 h under flowing oxygen. For comparison, a pristine sample was obtained by annealing pristine Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05(OH)2 and LiOH·H2O with the same molar ratio and sintering process. For convenience, the KMnO4 treated Ni0.8Co0.25Al0.05(OH)2 precursor and the pristine one are labeled as T-precursor and U-precursor; and the materials synthesized from them are labeled as T-NCA and U-NCA respectively.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Rigaku Rint-2000 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (1.54056 Å). The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, JSM-5612LV). The amount of Mn attached onto the material particles is detected by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, IRIS Intrepid II XSP). Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600, Perkin–Elmer) measurements were performed to get information on the surface of the materials.

CR 2025 coin-type cells were assembled with metallic lithium anodes for electrochemistry studies. The positive electrodes were fabricated by casting a slurry consisting of as-prepared sample (80 wt%), Super P carbon black (10 wt%) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) (10 wt%) dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) onto an aluminum foil with a doctor blade, followed by drying at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1:1 ethylene carbonate/ethyl methyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate was used as electrolyte. The cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (Mikrouna) with O2 and H2O lower than 0.5 ppm, and cycled galvanostatically between 2.8 and 4.3 V (vs. Li/Li+) (or between 2.8 and 4.5 V for overcharge behaviors study) at a desired current density.
