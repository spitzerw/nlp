The Li10GeP2S12 and Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4 solid electrolytes were prepared by mechanical milling using a jar mill apparatus and subsequent heat-treatment. The reagent grade Li2S (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), GeS2 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and P2S5 (99%, Aladdin Chemistry. Co., Ltd.) were used as the starting materials. Firstly, these materials were mixed thoroughly in molar ratio of Li2S:GeS2:P2S5 to 5:1:1 and 13:2:3 in order to synthesize Li10GeP2S12 and Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4 solid electrolytes, respectively. Then, the above mixtures were mechanically milled at 200 rpm for 12 h using a jar mill apparatus (GSM-1-2, Changsha Mitr Instrument and Equipment Co., Ltd.). The obtained precursors of the Li10GeP2S12 and Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4 were pressed into pellets under 200 MPa, sealed into a carbon-coated quartz tube and heat-treated at 680 °C and 500 °C for 8 h, respectively. After that, the samples were slowly cooled to room temperature. The pellets were ground to obtain the final products. All the processes were conducted in an argon-filled glove box.
For the prepared LiNi0.80Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode material, the Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05–(OH)2 precursor (Jintian New Energy Co., Ltd.) and Li(OH)·H2O (99.9%, Aladdin Chemistry. Co., Ltd.) were used as starting materials. The precursors were grinded homogeneously with LiOH·H2O in appropriate molar ratios in the mortar using ethanol as solvent. After evaporating the solvent, the mixture was preheated at 500 °C for 6 h, and subsequently sintered at 750 °C for 12 h in a continuous oxygen flow. The as-sintered samples were reground by ball milling for 8 h in ethanol solvent using a planetary ball mill apparatus to control the morphology and particle size distribution of the NCA positive materials. And then the samples were post-annealed at 750 °C for 5 h in a continuous oxygen flow in order to recover particle surface and reduce the lattice defects of NCA cathodes.
Laboratory-scale solid-state cells were constructed as follows. For composite positive electrodes, the as-synthesized NCA sample was mixed with the Li10GeP2S12 or Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4 solid electrolytes in weight ratio of 70:30 using an agate mortar, and 10 mg of the mixture was used as the cathode. Li–In alloy foil (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) was used as a counter electrode. The mass ratio of Li and In foil is approximately 60:1. A bilayer pellet, consisting of solid electrolytes (100 mg) and composite positive electrode materials (10 mg), was obtained by pressing under 240 MPa (diameter 10 mm) successively. Then, the Li–In alloy foil (diameter 10 mm, thickness 0.1 mm) was attached to the other side of solid electrolytes in the bilayer pellet by pressing under 360 MPa. All the processes were performed in an argon-filled glove box.

Rate performance, cycling stability, and low temperature electrochemical performance of the NCA in the all solid state lithium battery were investigated by galvanostatic charge–discharge testing. The temperature was controlled in a temperature chamber (SU-641, ESPEC Corp.). The cell charge and discharge tests were performed in galvanostatic mode under 0.1 C, 0.2 C, 0.5 C, and 1 C rate at room temperature and 0.1 C rate at − 10 °C by using a multichannel battery test system (LAND CT-2001A, Wuhan Rambo Testing Equipment Co., Ltd.). The cutoff voltage was set in the voltage range between 2.0 V and 3.7 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out by using a Solartron 1470E (Solartron Public Co., Ltd.) multi-channel potentiostats electrochemical workstation in the frequency range from 0.01 to 1 MHz with the amplitude of 10 mV.
