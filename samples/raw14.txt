Silicon/carbon (Si/C)
composite was synthesized by mechanical milling followed by
pyrolysis.The synthetic procedures can be briefly described as
follows: (1) mixing raw materials of 1.00 g nano-Si (>99.9%,
∼30 nm, Shuitian Materials Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
China), 4.00 g graphite (>99%, ∼0.5 𝜇m, Qingdao Tianhe
Graphite Co., Ltd., Shandong, China), and 3.85 g phenolic
resin by magnetic stirring and ultrasonic treatment, using
alcohol as dispersing agent; (2) ball milling for 10 h and drying
in the oven at 90∘
C overnight (denoted as the precursor); (3)
pyrolysis at 750∘
C for 2 h under argon atmosphere.
pan) using Cu K𝛼 radiation
was employed to identify the crystalline phase of the
synthesized materials. Thermal analysis of the as-prepared
samples was performed on a SDT Q600 TG-DTA (TE, USA)
apparatus between room temperature and 1 000∘
C at a heating
rate of 10∘
C min−1 in argon atmosphere. The morphology of
the samples was observed by scanning electron microscope
(SEM, JEOL, JSM-5612LV) with an accelerating voltage of
20 kV, and the microstructure of the composite was investigated
by transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai
G12, 200 kV).
The electrochemical performance was evaluated via a
standard Li//LiPF6 (EC : EMC : DMC = 1 : 1 : 1; v/v/v)//Si/C
CR2025 coin cell. To fabricate the working electrode,
80 wt.% active materials, 10 wt.% acetylene black, and 10 wt.%
poly(vinylidene fluoride) were firstly blended in N-methyl
pyrrolidinone to obtain homogeneous slurry, and then the
slurry was spread uniformly on a copper foil and dried at
120∘
C for 12 h in the air; the desirable working electrode
can be obtained after being cut into round pieces with an
area of 1.54 cm2
. The whole assembling processes of the cell
were carried out in a dry argon-filled glove box. The chargedischarge
tests of the cell were performed on a Neware battery
tester (Neware, Shenzhen) with cut-off voltage of 0.01–
2.00 V at room temperature. The electrochemical impedance
measurement was performed on a CHI660A electrochemical
workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai), in which the impedance
spectra were recorded w
