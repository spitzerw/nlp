Powder LTAP was prepared using a wet-chemical process with
a stoichiometric mixture of lithium chloride (LiCl), titanium butoxide (Ti(OCH2(CH2)2CH3)4), aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), and ammonium
dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4). The precursors were
dissolved in distilled water, and titanium butoxide solution was
added dropwise to the prepared solution with constant stirring.
The resultant solution was ball-milled for 24 h. The mixture was
dried at 80 8C, and the obtained powder was heated to 10008C for
4 h in air.
A PVdF polymer was used as a binder. The PVdF solution was prepared
in dimethylacetamide (DMAc)/acetone (1:2 volume ratio) solvent.
The prepared LTAP powder was added to the polymer solution
and mixed to prepare the slurry. The prepared slurry was cast
onto a glass plate using a doctor blade with a flow of distilled
water to the sample. Then, the LTPA-based composite solid membrane
floated to the distilled water layer. The composite mem
brane was pressed with a 2-tonne press and dried in a vacuum
oven (808C, 24 h). The LTAP-based composite solid electrolyte was
prepared by soaking the solid membrane for 20 min in a solution
of 1m LiPF6
in EC/DMC. The ionic conductivity was calculated by
s=l/(RÕ A) equation, where R is total resistance (ohm), l is thickness
of sample (cm), and A is area of sample (cm2).
To prepare the electrode, the active material powder (cathode: LiMn2O4, anode: graphite), super-p carbon black, and poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) binder were mixed in a ratio of 70:10:20 by
weight. The complete mixture was rolled and pressed into thin
sheets. The flexible solid cell was stacked as follows: prepared
cathode sheet/LTAP-based composite solid electrolyte/anode
sheet. The electrochemical cell test was performed using an automatic
galvanostatic charge–discharge unit (WonATech. Co.) with
a 2032 coin-type cell between 0.1 and 1.5 V with a 0.1 mA current
density.
